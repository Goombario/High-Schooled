High Schooled is a turn-based strategy game where your wit is the difference between a pass and a fail. Play as a variety of characters to take on bullies, terrible teacher, and the occasional pop quiz. Compete with your friends for the highest mark and, of course, bragging rights. Will you graduate with honours or will you be schooled?
